  formula: "Singular Subject ➜ Verb + s/es | Plural/I/You ➜ Base Verb",
  explanation: "In the Simple Present Tense, the verb changes form based on the number of the subject.\n\n1. Singular Subjects (He, She, It, The Cat): The verb must end in -s or -es (e.g., eats, goes).\n2. Plural Subjects (They, We, The Cats): The verb stays in its base form without an 's' (e.g., eat, go).\n\nImportant Exception: The pronouns 'I' and 'You' always take the base form of the verb, even though they refer to single individuals.",
  examples: [
    {
      sentence: "She walks to school every day.",
      subject: "She",
      verb: "walks",
      reason: "'She' is a singular, third-person pronoun, so the verb 'walks' needs an '-s' ending."
    },
    {
      sentence: "The cat runs across the yard.",
      subject: "The cat",
      verb: "runs",
      reason: "'The cat' is a singular subject, so the verb 'runs' ends in '-s'."
    },
    {
      sentence: "David writes novels for a living.",
      subject: "David",
      verb: "writes",
      reason: "A proper noun like 'David' is a singular, third-person subject, requiring the verb 'writes'."
    },
    {
      sentence: "They run every day.",
      subject: "They",
      verb: "run",
      reason: "'They' is a plural subject, so it takes the base form of the verb, 'run'."
    },
    {
      sentence: "I run to the store.",
      subject: "I",
      verb: "run",

    {
      sentence: "The earth goes round the sun.",
