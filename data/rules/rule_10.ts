  explanation: "Indefinite pronouns that end in -one, -body, or -thing are grammatically Singular, even though they may seem to refer to a group.\n\nList of Singular Pronouns:\nEveryone, Everybody, Everything, Anyone, Anybody, Anything, Someone, Somebody, Something, No one, Nobody, Nothing.\n\nThe Rule: Treat these pronouns as singular subjects. (e.g., 'Everyone has a dream').",
  examples: [
    {
      sentence: "Everyone is welcome.",
      subject: "Everyone",
      verb: "is",
      reason: "'Everyone' is a singular indefinite pronoun."
    },
    {
      sentence: "Something smells good.",
      subject: "Something",
      verb: "smells",
      reason: "'Something' is singular, so the verb has an '-s'."
    },
    {
      sentence: "Nobody knows the answer.",
      subject: "Nobody",
      verb: "knows",
      reason: "'Nobody' is always treated as singular."
