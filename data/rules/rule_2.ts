  formula: "Subject ➜ Auxiliary Verb (matches number & person)",
  explanation: "Primary auxiliary verbs help form tenses, negatives, and questions. Unlike regular verbs, they change form significantly to match the subject.\n\n1. Be (am/is/are):\n   - Use 'am' for 'I'.\n   - Use 'is' for singular subjects (He, She, It).\n   - Use 'are' for plural subjects (We, They) and 'You'.\n\n2. Have (has/have):\n   - Use 'has' for singular subjects.\n   - Use 'have' for plural subjects, 'I', and 'You'.\n\n3. Do (does/do):\n   - Use 'does' for singular subjects.\n   - Use 'do' for plural subjects, 'I', and 'You'.",

        subject: "Swetha",
        verb: "has",
        reason: "'Swetha' is a singular subject, so it requires the singular auxiliary verb 'has'."

        sentence: "I have a younger brother.",
        subject: "I",
        verb: "have",

        subject: "They",
        verb: "do",
